# Welcome to Data Structures

```markdown
A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively

- Make fast and powerful algorithms
- Manage and organize data
- Make code cleaner and easier to understand

### Abstract Data Type (ADT)

An ADT is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data striucture must adhere to.

The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language

| Abstraction (ADT) |                      Implementation (DS)                      |
| :---------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------: |
|       List        |                  Dynamic Array, Linked List                   |
|       Queue       | Linked list based Queue, Array based Queue, Stack based Queue |
|        Map        |                  Tree Map, Hash Map / Table                   |
